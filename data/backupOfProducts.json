Fusing elements of the 1990 classic with official imagery of the Red Planet, the shoe swaps traditional stitching for a seamless finish, molded to imitate the original\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overlay design. A Mars Rover wheel inspired graphic highlights the outsole, which sits below a starry space inspired midsole. The Magma Orange was matched as close as possible to actual surface photos of Mars, while reflective 3M hits on the tongue and back tab provide contrast.  \n",
